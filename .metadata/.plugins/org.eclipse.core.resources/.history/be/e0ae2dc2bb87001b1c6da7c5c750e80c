		/* Serialization = The process of converting an object into a byte stream.
		 *				   Persists (saves the state) the object after program exits.
		 *				   this byte stream can be saved as a file or sent over network  
		 *				   can be sent to different networks  	
		 *				   Byte stream can be saved as a file (.ser) which is platform 
		 *		 		   independent. (think of this as if you're saving a file with the object info)  
		 *  			   
		 *  
		 *  			   Steps to serialize
		 *  			   -------------------------------------------------------------	
		 *  			   1. Your object class should implement Serializable interface
		 *  			   2. add import java.io.Serializable;
		 *  			   3. FileOutputStream fileOut = new FileOutputStream(file path)
		 *  			   4. ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(fileOut)
		 *  			   5. out.writeObject(objectName)
		 *  			   6. out.close(); fileOut.close;
		 *  
		 * Deserialization = The reverse process of converting byte stream into an object
